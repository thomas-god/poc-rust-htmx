# poc-rust-htmx

A proof of concept to see how far you can go with rust + htmx

## Goals

- [x] How to integrate the view/templating layer into a Rust application,
      without introducing coupling in the domain layer,
- [x] How to expose both a JSON-based API and a htmx-based client without
      duplicating business logic,
- [ ] How do to htmx with websocket,
- [x] Integrate tailwindcss/daisyui within the template/output HTML,
- [ ] _(Optional)_ Deploy it somewhere to check for any pitfalls.
- [ ] _(Optional)_ Is it possible to have hot reload (templates + app) ?
